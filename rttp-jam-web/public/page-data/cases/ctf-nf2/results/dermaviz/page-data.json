Currently, we do not have ways to predict which patients will develop certain characteristics or respond to therapies. In order to improve management of NF1, including both risk stratification and targeted therapeutics, a better understanding of disease heterogeneity is needed. A recent study by Tabata et. al. (under review) identified phenotypic subtypes. However, genotypic and phenotypic data is needed from a large sample size (>2000) in order to perform genome-wide association studies to identify novel modifiers of disease to further understand heterogeneity. Our work creates a novel method of data collection that will enable rapid data collection of phenotypic, genotypic, and 3D patient data in order to rapidly advance research for NF1. This solution will enable personalized risk stratification, development of therapeutics, and response to therapeutics. Integration of our solution with existing data will synergistically result in a powerful database for discovery.
