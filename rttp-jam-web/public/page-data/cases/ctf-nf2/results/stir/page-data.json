While no therapy presently exists, the decision for surgical resection of the tumors requires accuratly measuring tumor involvement and monitoring of disease progress. In addition, a clinician evaluating potential therapies requires accurate assessment to determine efficacy of treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with its sensitivity to soft-tissue tumors is the current gold-standard for non-invasive evaluation.
